/**
 * The `AylaSetup` class is used to connect to a device in AP mode. that is, a device that is not currently configured to join
 * a locally available Wi-Fi network. Devices that are not able to join a Wi-Fi network will put themselves into AP mode 
 * automatically and broadcast an SSID that is identifiable as an Ayla device.
 *
 * Once the user has connected their phone or tablet to the device's AP, the application can call `connectToNewDevice:failure:` to let the SDK
 * confirm the connection and setup the device.
 *
 * Then application could give a call to `startDeviceScanForAccessPoints:failure:` to let the device scan for visible Wi-Fi access points
 * and call `fetchDeviceAccessPoints:failure:` to fetch the scan result from the device. 
 * @note Some devices may need several seconds to complete the scan request. It's good practice to delay before making a `fetch` call.
 *
 * Once the user selects an SSID and enters the password, the application can invoke
 * `connectDeviceToServiceWithSSID:password:setupToken:latitude:longitude:success:failure:` to let the device connect to
 * that SSID.
 *
 * In order to confirm that the device has successfully connected to the Wi-Fi network, the method
 * `confirmDeviceConnectedWithTimeout:dsn:setupToken:success:failure:` can be called to verify the device's connection.
 *
 * The `-exit` can be manually called to manually top the setup of a device. The method will also be called automatically when `AylaSetup` is
 * going to be deallocated.
